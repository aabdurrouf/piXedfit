# Example of FUV-NIR images + CALIFA IFS data analysis with piXedfit

In this tutorial, we will use piXedfit for analyzing spatially resolved spectrophotometric SEDs (a combination of photometry and spectroscopy) of a local galaxy NGC 309. We will combine 12-bands imaging data from the GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE surveys, and integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from the CALIFA survey. To run the jupyter notebooks files, you will need to download the data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RKJAHLFXNZdWLPbQ-i4Po8WjKcUbGx_m?usp=sharing).
