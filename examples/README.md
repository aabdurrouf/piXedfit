# Examples of analysis of Imaging data and integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data with piXedfit

* `FUVtoFIR`: analysis of 23-band imaging data ranging from far-ultraviolet (FUV) to far-infrared (FIR) --> target galaxy M51
* `FUVtoNIR_MaNGA`: analysis of 12-band imaging data ranging from FUV to near-infrared (NIR), combined with IFS data from MaNGA survey
* `FUVtoNIR_CALIFA`: analysis of 12-band imaging data ranging from FUV to near-infrared (NIR), combined with IFS data from CALIFA survey --> target galaxy NGC 309
* Tutorial of automatically downloading images from the servers of GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, and Spitzer surveys
* Tutorial of generating model spectra at rest-frame 


To do list:
* Upload tutorial on SED fitting with varius forms of priors, including joint priors such as mass-metallicity and mass-age priors.
* Upload tutorial on SED fitting in which redshift is free (i.e., photometric redshift).
