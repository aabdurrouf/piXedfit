# Example of FUV--FIR images analysis with piXedfit

In this tutorial, we will use piXedfit for analyzing spatially resolved SEDs of M51. We will combine 23-bands imaging data ranging from FUV to FIR taken from various telescopes. To run the jupyter notebooks files, you will need to download the data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_1Zg0izW4OQ1xgvbOiZKmXIe7hIZUv3?usp=sharing).
